            Migration of Traditional IT System to Cloud Computing with Amazon Web Services

The purpose of this project was to migrate the on-premises information technology systems of an organization to the cloud. 
The migration was implemented using the Amazon WebServices technology.


The transformation process to the cloud involved studying the existing system of the organization, 
designing 3-tier cloud architecture on the web, application and database tiers. 
The implementation was done using the tools and technologies of the Amazon Web Services.

The migration of the existing traditional system resulted in delivering better storage, computing, databases 
and other services. Moreover, the work resulted in improved reliability and performance by minimizing
the cost of administration and support. The Amazon Web Services provided cutting edge technologies
and tools to migrate to the cloud.
